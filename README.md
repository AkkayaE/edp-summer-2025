## FAQ
### What should I do if I can't attend 80% of classes?
If you know that for some reason you would not be able to attend at least 80% classes (due to visa problems, work, health)
* you must inform me not later than on the 4th classes of the semester
* depending on the situation I might be able to prepare an exam for you/self study resources etc. to allow to pass the course faster

### What code editor should I use?
* We use CodeSpaces on GitHub
* For some simpler tasks we may use Jupyter Notebooks [Link](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/index.html)
